Colour picker is a standalone utility that replicates a colour selection tool
found in popular paint programs. It allows the user to store 8 previously used
colours which can then be saved into files for use later. The 8 colours last
stored in the history area, as well as the current colour, are automatically
saved. The 'target' icon in the lower right corner can be dragged to anywhere
on the users screen and it will find the colour of the selected pixel allowing
you to easily find the colour used, for example, on another web site.
